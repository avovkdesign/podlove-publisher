The one and only next generation podcast publishing system. Seriously. It's magical and sparkles a lot.

== Description ==

We built the Podlove Podcast Publisher because existing solutions are stuck in the past, complex and unwieldy. The Publisher helps you save time, worry less and provides a cutting edge listening experience for your audience.

Official Site: [publisher.podlove.org](http://publisher.podlove.org/)

= Video Tutorial: Getting started with Podlove Publisher =

= Compatible Feeds =

The Publisher makes it easy to create highly expressive, efficient and super compatible podcast feeds with fine grained control over client behavior (e.g. GUID control to replace faulty episodes and for clients to reload) supporting all important meta data.

= Multi-Format Publishing =

The Publisher also makes multi-format publishing - embracing all modern and legacy audio and video codecs - a snap. By adopting simple file name conventions, the plugin allows the podcaster to provide individual feeds for certain use cases or audiences without adding work for the podcaster during the publishing process.

= Optimized Web Player =

The Publisher also comes with integrated with the Podlove Web Player plugin (which you do not need to install separately) and fully support its advanced options including multiple audio (MP4 AAC, MP3, Vorbis, Opus) and video (MP4 H.264, WebM, Theora) format support for web browsers. This Web Player is fully HTML5 compatible (but provides Flash fallback for ancient environments) and is ready for all touch based clients too.

= Chapter Support =

The Publisher also makes it easy to publish chapter information in the player to make access to structured episodes even easier. Full support for linking directly to any part of your podcast on the web with instant playback included.

= Flexible Templates =

To round it all up, a flexible template system enables you to published Podcasts in a defined fashion and change the style at any time without having to touch your individual postings later on.

And this is just the beginning. We have a rich roadmap that will bring even more interesting features: integration with helpful services, much improved timeline metadata support (show notes) and much more.

== Changelog ==

= 2021-11-01 =

**Contributors**

- Notifications: add "always send to..." section. Contributors selected there will always receive update notifications.
- Avatars: default avatar is now a static svg instead of Gravatar (can be customized using the WordPress Filter `podlove_default_contributor_avatar_url`)

**Shownotes**

- adjust export file format
- fix various css issues
- show quicksort menu as soon as one topic exists (instead of requiring two)

**Other**

- fix(image cache): redirect to source URL if image can't be downloaded into the cache

= 2021-10-28 =

First draft of Shownotes rework with focus on quickly sorting a large amount of
links into topics. Not all of the previous functionality is working yet, but
most. The new sorting mechanism still needs some work, but it's a
proof-of-concept.

= 2021-10-09 =

**Enhancements for creating Auphonic productions** (thanks [lumaxis](https://github.com/lumaxis)!):

- when the episode title is set, send this instead of the post title ([#1240](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1240))
- send the episode number as track number ([#1240](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1240))
- when the post thumbnail is configured as cover image, use it as direct fallback  ([#1241](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1241))

**Webhooks**

Define a webhook that gets triggered every time an episode updates.

The webhook is a `POST` request with an `event` parameter and a `payload`.
`event` is the webhook name ("episode_updated"), `payload` is a serialized
JSON object of the current episode.

Configuration:

    # wp-config.php
    define('PODLOVE_WEBHOOKS', [
        'episode_updated' => 'https://example.com/webhook-endpoint'
    ]);

= 2021-09-20 =
